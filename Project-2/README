For this project, I built a full DTMF decoder in MATLAB that can identify phone numbers from audio recordings.
I first wrote an encoder that generates touch-tone signals for each key using two specific frequencies, then
developed a decoder to detect those frequencies and map them to the correct digits. I expanded the decoder to
handle full sequences of phone numbers with unknown digit durations and noise. I tested it with clean and noisy
recordings and analyzed how accuracy drops as background noise increases. This helped me understand frequency
analysis, noise robustness, and real-world signal processing challenges.
