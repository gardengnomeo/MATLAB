For this project, I implemented and tested a basic digital communication system in MATLAB using
matched filtering. I created a function to decode noisy binary signals into readable ASCII messages
using pulse shapes and convolution. Then, I built a transmitter function that encoded messages into
triangular waveforms, added noise, and tested how well the original message could be recovered. I
experimented with different pulse shapes under increasing noise and compared their decoding accuracy.
This project helped me understand the role of matched filters and noise robustness in digital signal
recovery.
